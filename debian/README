xball for DEBIAN and Ubuntu
---------------------------

Per Debian policy recommendations the program is installed in
/usr/games (not /usr/bin). That means it is not in the normal
PATH. The program can be started either from the window manager menu
structure or with the following command:

$ /usr/games/xball
