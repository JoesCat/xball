    This program simulates bouncing balls in a window.  You create the balls
    in a variety of ways, and can set the gravity, elasticity, whether balls
    collide or not, etc.</p>
    <p xml:lang="C">
    Young children enjoy watching the balls bounce around the screen and are
    fascinated by the program. This is an ideal program for teaching rudimentary
    mouse skills to very young children.</p>
    <p xml:lang="C">
    To run the 14 included demo scripts, open a console terminal and type
    'run_demos' to see each demo one after the next.</p>
